Objective :
	A player plays against the computer and try to sink its boats.

Gameplay and rules :
	A player is againt the computer. The first step is to place four ships of different sizes on the grid, the player can choose also their orientation (either the X or Y axis). The computer will place its ships randomly on the grid. A ship is considered as a line of grid boxes, the number of boxes depends on the boat’s size.

	Once all ships are placed, every turn a player chooses a spot on the grid and takes a shot. If it is a miss, their turn ends.

On the other hand, if the shot hits one of the opponent’s ships, the player gets another chance. They can fire as long as their hits connect with an enemy boat.

	A boat is considered as destroyed once of all its grid boxes have been hit once.
	The game ends when one of the players no longer has any boats afloat and its opponent is declared winner.

Custom rules:
	If they choose so, the player can modify some rules and create custom rulesets.

For instance, and as long as one rule doesn’t interfere with the other (100 boats on a 2x2 grid for example), they can change:
-	Grid size
-	Number of boats
-	Ships’ length
-	Turn limit (the player has to destroy all of the boats in a limited amount of turns)
